This project is used to create the api for nepal .

## Why this code is all about

# WHAT TO DO ?

\*\*#add the data by googling every detail of the district and i don't have any usefull feature for that so you need to add manually and get me that file of api.json .
and just get that file and add that file into the existing aqi-index code that contains the folder called district_data.json add the data manually . !

\_\_ Make sure to make it secure and noone can get that , and miss around it !!
